<h1> 
    FINAL PROJECT CONCEPT
</h1>

<p>
    For my final project I decided to make a trivia using Javascript, Css, and Html which will be about the beginner concepts of HTML and CSS. I plan to make it about 8 questions which will give a score in the end. Quesions will be like what does CSS stand for, what does a closing tag for a heading look like, etc.
