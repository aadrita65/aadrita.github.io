        "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush
    </h1>
    <p>
        Vannevar Bush describes a future information system that would enable people to access, store, and retrieve knowledge in his article “As We May Think”.  The essay is considered as a key text in the development of hypertext and the World Wide Web. Bush begins by describing the immense amount of information that was being produced and stored during World War II, and argues that existing methods for accessing and using this information were inadequate.
        The device, which Bush refers to as a "memex," would be a desk with two screens: one for displaying information, and one for inputting commands. The memex would allow users to create links of information, linking together related documents and ideas and allowing easy access and navigation. Bush argues that a system like this would help individuals access and use information more effectively, but also spark new ideas and discoveries.
        Bush's idea of the memex had a big influence on the growth of hypertext and the World Wide Web, even if it was never fully realized. Many of the ideas that Bush described in his article, like the ability to link together related documents, have become central to our understanding of how the internet functions today.

        "Long Live The Web" by Tim Berners Lee
    </h1>
    <p>
        In his essay "Long Live the Web," Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, analyzes the past, present, and future of the internet. He begins by describing how, over the past 20 years, the web has developed from a simple platform to a complex one filled with social interactions. He also discusses some of the difficulties that the web faces today including data privacy and security.
One of the biggest threats to the web is the increasing concentration of power in the hands of a few large corporations. Google and Facebook, etc, control large amounts of data that sway the web into their favor. Berners-Lee contends that we must take action in a number of areas if we are to maintain the original intent of the web. The internet and the information it offers must first be made available to everyone. Also, user’s privacy and data needs to be protected so that they can use the web freely without having the fear of exploitation and surveillance.
