        Squash and Stretch: all objects have a certain degree of flexibility and will change shape when subjected to outside forces or motions. This idea aids in creating the impression of weight and motion for a character or item.
<br>
Anticipation: To get the audience ready for a specific action or movement, employ anticipation. It can be used to increase the plausibility of an action and to establish expectation.
<br>
Staging:  A clean and understandable presentation of an idea or story. It entails focusing the audience's attention on aspects of the animation by using composition, lighting, and camera angles.
<br>
Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose: These are two various methods of animation. Pose-to-pose animation involves planning out the main poses or actions and then filling in the in-between frames as opposed to straight-ahead action, which involves animating frame by frame from beginning to end. Depending on the circumstance, either approach can be used successfully.
<br>
Follow Through and Overlapping Action: This principle relates to the notion that not all components of a character or object will move simultaneously or uniformly. There will be follow-through and overlapping action because of some parts moving more quickly than others.
<br>
Slow In and Out: Using this principle, an action is started and ended gradually to produce a movement that looks more natural. Giving an object or character the appearance of weight and mass is helpful.
<br>
Arcs: Are used to produce motion that is more fluid and realistic-looking. To make their animations appear more realistic, animators use the idea that most movements in real life have an arc or curve.
<br>
Secondary Action: This idea entails adding extra gestures or actions to a character's main action to support it. It can be used to give an animation more complexity and depth.
<br>
Timing: It is important in animation because it contributes to the rhythm and pacing of the work. Timing of important poses must also take movement and action speed into account.
<br>
Exaggeration: Is used to highlight specific elements of an animation, such as facial expressions, body language, or feelings. It can also be used to add humor or entertainment value to an animation.
<br>
Solid Drawing: Gives the appearance of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. It necessitates a thorough understanding of movement, perspective, and anatomy.
<br>
Appeal: It entails developing settings and characters that are captivating to viewers and visually appealing.
